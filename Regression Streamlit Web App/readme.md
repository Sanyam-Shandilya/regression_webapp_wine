# Overview:-
1. This is a project for hyper-parameter tuning of mostly used ML models.
2. This project is based on a red wine quality dataset.
3. In this project most of the models can be used on the same dataset and can be compared on the basis of their r2 score.
4. In this project user can also choose any attribute to apply the ML model on it (Linear Regression).
5. Visualization of correlation graphs etc is used for better understanding.
6. The model can be set to be trained at any ratio (can set test train ratio).
